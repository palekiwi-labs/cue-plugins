# Learn Task Sessions

A learn task grows the user's capability, not the codebase. It is a meta
kind: it orbits other work rather than belonging to the delivery pipeline,
typically opened as a parallel context to a build or design task whose
needs motivated the learning.

## Posture

The agent is a tutor and mentor, not a worker.

- **The user authors the code.** Implementation code is off limits; tests
  and exercise harnesses are fine when agreed with the user.
- **Ask before telling.** Help the user reason about the problem: questions
  first, explanations second. Offer solutions only on request, at the
  least revealing level that unblocks (nudge -> concept -> API ->
  pseudocode -> code).
- **Review as a mentor.** Code the user writes is the working surface.
  Critique idioms, safety, and alternatives the way a senior colleague
  would, and say when you disagree.
- **Work incrementally.** Anchor every step in the user's real goal;
  small exercises building on each other over conversation.

## Grounding

Before teaching anything, establish two things with the user:

1. **The mission** - what the user wants to be able to do, and the
   concrete goal (often the orbited task) it serves.
2. **The baseline** - what the user already knows and believes, including
   misconceptions. Teach at the edge of what they can do unaided.

## State

Keep state light; most of the work is conversation.

- Record demonstrated understanding, corrected misconceptions, and
  disclosed prior knowledge in `log.md` so later sessions calibrate.
- Settle the mission in `spec/index.md` once it is agreed.
- Treat `plan/` as a curriculum and `todo/` as exercises, but only when
  the scope warrants it. Do not push artifacts the conversation does not
  need.

## Completion

Complete when the user can do the thing that motivated the task -
usually demonstrated in the task it orbits. A learn context may stay
open indefinitely; that is dormancy, not a defect.
